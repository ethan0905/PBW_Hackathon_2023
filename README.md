## ❗ Problem
#### What problem does your project solve? 
1. Deadline for payement not respected  
2. Terms of contract not respected  
3. Too long dispute problems  
  
#### How does it fit into the theme "Onboarding the next million" ?  
Blockchain is invisible. The solution is web2 friendly and solve a real problematic. Easier to convert people.
    
## ✅ Solution
#### How did you resolve this issue?  
1. We decided to solve this issue, creating a decentralized and trusted environment that protect the 2 users during money transfer (service-for-money).  
2. For each mission, we create a unique smart contract that is not editable and not replicable.  
3. We store the documents on decentralised database (IPFS).
  
It is a simply-to-use contract creator tool that allows any users to create their own traditional contract, but…. directly on blockchain !  
  
We create a climate of trust for every users (Open Trust Framework Model).  

#### What was your biggest technical challenge and how does your solution solve it?
Work on a mobile experience instead of web experience. No experience with Solana ecosystem. Work as a team of 8 peoples.  
Our solution solve it by creating a form interface that write directly into our smart contract.
