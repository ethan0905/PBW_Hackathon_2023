This project was created for the 2023 Paris Blockchain Week Hackathon.

## ü§è Pitch
#### Where does the idea of payconsent come from ?
Actually, we, as newly freelance devs, have been experiencing issues with a client payment. Even to this day we did not receive the money. 
We wanted to solve this problem using Blockchain technology.
And that‚Äôs how we thought about Payconsent.

## üìî Summary

 - ‚ùó Problem
 - ‚úÖ Solution
 - ‚öôÔ∏è How to run the project ?

## ‚ùó Problem
#### What problem does your project solve? 
1. Contract falsification  
2. Deadline for payment not respected  
3. Terms of contract not respected  
  
#### How does it fit into the theme "Building a Decentralized Future"?  
The solution is independant, self governing.  
    
## ‚úÖ Solution
#### How did you resolve this issue?  
1. We decided to solve this issue, by creating an easy to use and decentralized payement protocol service that protect the 2 users during transaction (service-for-money).  
2. For each mission, we create a unique smart contract that is not editable and not replicable.  

  
It is a simply-to-use contract creator tool that allows any users to create their own traditional contract, but‚Ä¶. directly on blockchain !  
  
We create a climate of trust for every users (Open Trust Framework Model).  
  
#### What technologies did you use?
- Solana blockchain
- Anchor framework
- ReactJS 
- Figma to design and prototype the website
